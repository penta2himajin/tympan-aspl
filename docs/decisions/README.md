# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the project's settled architectural decisions.

## Why ADRs

`CLAUDE.md` lists ADRs as a top-tier source of truth. When the same
question recurs across sessions or PRs, the answer belongs here so it
does not get rewritten each time.

## Lifecycle

- ADRs are numbered sequentially. Filenames follow
  `NNNN-kebab-case-summary.md`.
- An ADR is **Accepted** when merged. Status may later move to
  **Superseded by ADR NNNN** if a follow-up decision overturns it.
  The superseded record stays in the tree for historical context — it
  is not deleted.
- ADRs are short. A single page of context, decision, consequences,
  and (where useful) a documented reversal trigger.
