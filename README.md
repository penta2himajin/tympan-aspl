# tympan-aspl

A Rust framework for writing macOS AudioServerPlugins.

`tympan-aspl` provides Rust abstractions over the Core Audio HAL
AudioServerPlugin interface, enabling Rust applications to implement
custom virtual audio devices and audio drivers on macOS without
writing C++ or Objective-C.

## Status

**Design phase.** No implementation yet. See [`docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md)
for planned scope and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the
planned API design.

## Naming

*Tympan* — the tympanal organ of moths, a membrane-based ultrasound sensor
on the abdomen of pyralid and noctuid moths. Evolved to detect the
echolocation calls of bats. The name reflects the library's role: a thin
membrane between the OS audio engine and user-space Rust code.
