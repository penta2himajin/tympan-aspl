//! `tympan-aspl` — a Rust framework for writing macOS
//! AudioServerPlugins.
//!
//! AudioServerPlugins are the user-space audio drivers that run
//! inside `coreaudiod` and appear to the system as audio devices.
//! `tympan-aspl` provides safe Rust abstractions over the Core Audio
//! HAL AudioServerPlugin C interface so a Rust crate can implement a
//! virtual audio device — a loopback, a virtual microphone, a
//! routing or processing driver — without writing C++ or
//! Objective-C.
//!
//! See `docs/overview.md` for the project's scope and
//! `docs/architecture.md` for the design that drives this crate.
//!
//! ## Layering
//!
//! The crate is built bottom-up in conceptual layers, isolated by
//! module boundary:
//!
//! - `raw` — the low-level FFI to the AudioServerPlugin C ABI and
//!   the CFPlugIn vtable bookkeeping. macOS-only
//!   (`cfg(target_os = "macos")`). *Stub at this stage* — the
//!   cross-platform foundation lands first; see the module docs.
//! - [`realtime`] — allocation-free, lock-free primitives for the
//!   `IOProc` realtime callback. Cross-platform, so the realtime
//!   invariants are unit-testable on any host.
//! - The object model — [`error`], [`fourcc`], [`object`],
//!   [`property`], [`mod@format`], [`io`] — cross-platform
//!   plain-data mirrors of the Core Audio C types.
//! - The property protocol — [`objects`] (the object tree) and
//!   [`dispatch`] (the cross-platform answer to the HAL's property
//!   reads).
//! - The public API — [`driver`], [`device`], [`stream`] — the
//!   traits and declarative types a consumer implements against.
//! - [`bundle`] — `.driver` bundle `Info.plist` generation.
//!
//! ## Realtime safety
//!
//! Any code reachable from the `IOProc` realtime callback must be
//! allocation-free, lock-free, and free of blocking syscalls. The
//! [`realtime`] module exposes a [`RealtimeContext`] marker that
//! acts as a compile-time witness for the realtime context;
//! [`Driver::process_io`] takes one. Mechanical enforcement lives in
//! `tests/realtime_safety.rs` via an `assert_no_alloc`
//! global-allocator guard.
//!
//! ## Implementing a driver
//!
//! A consumer implements [`Driver`] for a type carrying its
//! per-plug-in state, describes the device it exposes with a
//! [`DeviceSpec`], and — on macOS — exposes the type as a CFPlugIn
//! with the [`plugin_entry!`] macro.
